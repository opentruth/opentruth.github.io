In the world of a conscious being, self is everything.
 I should say, consciousness is everything.
 Consciousness is, after all, our only avenue
 toward so-called "self-awareness."
 Consciousness has been everything you have ever
 experienced. What is consciousness?
<br>Consciousness is this. Here, now, yes, you!
 This is your consciousness. Seems rather meager
 for one so sophisticated as yourself.
 Indeed, the human mind is undeniably weak.
 Take note: this is not to discount the strength of the human mind.
 Rather, this message is intended as a reminder.
<br>So great and delightful have our cities become,
 that we have forgotten the billions dead,
 the backs of the slaves scarred by the whip,
 the poverty and famine stretching for thousands of miles across the once-beautiful
 landscape of the Earth.
<br>This is a reminder that a human mind is not the great master it sees in the mirror.
 A human mind is something far greater and more powerful
 than it might believe itself to be.
 It is Atlantis sunk beneath waves of sorrow.
 It is Babylon smote down by the lightning of anger.
 It is the temple of Jerusalem, brought low by Egypt, then Assyria, then Babylon, then Rome,
 until nothing remained but a solitary wall dividing East from West, Israel from Palestine,
 rich from poor, evil from good.
<br>This is the tragedy of the modern age.
 The human has forgotten its own nature.
